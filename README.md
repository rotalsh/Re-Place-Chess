## Re-Place Chess

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My personal 
project will be a version of chess/shogi 
where the board is much smaller - *width 3 by height 4* - 
and each player will start with only the following 4 pieces:
- King (circle): moves one space in all 8 directions - if the king
is captured, the game ends
- Rook (+ sign): moves one space in the four cardinal directions
- Bishop (x sign): moves one space in the four diagonals
- Pawn (arrow): can only move one space forward - like regular 
chess, pawns can promote one reaching other side of
the board, but in this game, it can only promote to a 
queen
  - Queen (umbrella): results only in the case where a pawn promotes.
  A queen can move in every direction except the diagonal
  two back.

The thing that separates 
this version of chess from others (besides the 
aforementioned size/number differences) is that once you
capture any non-king piece, you can spend a turn to place
it down as your own piece. This allows for whole new 
strategies as the number of pieces on the board over time
doesn't necessarily always go down.
